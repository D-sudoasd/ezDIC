**A lightweight dual-mode strain workstation for image sequences.**

Main/source version: **0.1.4** · release-ready source · 2026-08-30

This source snapshot has no v0.1.4 tag or GitHub release. Any local ZIP is an
unverified working artifact; use the Releases page for a published, frozen-
smoke-verified Windows asset.

### v0.2.0 development target (not released)

The current development branch contains a narrowly scoped research-grade
upgrade. It does **not** bump `VERSION.txt`, `CITATION.cff`, the Zenodo record,
or the DOI: those remain the v0.1.4 metadata of this source snapshot. The
implemented development capability is a reproducible fixed-reference,
local-subset, in-plane 2D DIC workflow plus the existing 1D virtual
extensometer; it is not a claim of universal DIC superiority or experimental
accuracy.

The development target adds a GUI-independent core, reference-based
percentile normalization, bounded coarse-to-fine multiscale initialization,
IC-GN/IC-LM solver diagnostics, explicit point `valid` versus strain-fit
`strain_valid`, and hash-linked run provenance. The locked synthetic benchmark
is a regression gate, not an estimate of experimental uncertainty.

ezDIC has two explicit workflows:

1. **Virtual extensometer:** track two user-defined ROI markers and export engineering strain, true strain, QC, and Origin-compatible TXT (optional OPJU).
2. **Full-field 2D DIC:** correlate a rectangular ROI on a fixed reference frame with IC-GN or IC-LM, sample a POI grid, and export displacement and strain maps.

The full-field DIC workflow is an in-plane, local-subset 2D method. It does not replace stereo/3D DIC, DVC, or a global finite-element DIC system.

## Full-field output contract

Full-field analysis uses the first frame in the selected analysis range as one fixed reference. Each later frame is correlated to that same reference; the workflow does not silently switch to a frame-to-frame reference. The rectangular ROI is sampled at points of interest (POIs), so the result is a POI grid rather than a value at every image pixel. It is not a 3D measurement.

All images in the selected full-field range must have the same dimensions; a mismatch is a validation failure.

Full-field output is transactional. A new run first writes its candidate files
to a staging area. Only after the whole run completes normally are those files
committed to the `dic/` root as the current result. At commit time, old
successful `frame_####*` files are retention-moved to the output-root
`_previous_runs/<run_id>/` (a sibling of `dic/`), never silently overwritten.

The core output is fixed and is written under `dic/` for every analyzed deformation frame with a finite strain field. A failed frame is not exported as a successful result:

```text
dic/
├─ frame_0002.txt       # x, y, u, v, zncc, valid, Exx, Eyy, Exy, exx, eyy, exy
├─ frame_0002.csv
├─ frame_0002_u.png
├─ frame_0002_v.png
├─ frame_0002_Exx.png
├─ frame_0002_Eyy.png
├─ frame_0002_Exy.png
└─ frame_0002_parameters.txt
```

`x`, `y`, `u`, and `v` are in **px**. All strain components are **dimensionless**. `Exx`, `Eyy`, and `Exy` are Green–Lagrange components; `exx`, `eyy`, and `exy` are infinitesimal components. `Exy`/`exy` are **tensor shear components** (the off-diagonal strain terms), not engineering shear values with an extra factor of two.

The `valid` column records whether a POI correlation passed the quality threshold. Failed points are exported as `NaN` for measurement fields (`u`/`v`, strain, and quality fields as applicable); `x`/`y` remain the POI grid coordinates. Failed measurements are not interpolated or filled. A frame with no finite strain field is a **normally skipped failed frame**: it contributes no current-frame files, but other valid frames may still be committed if the run has no fatal error. If no analyzed deformation frame has valid strain points, the full-field run fails and is not reported as completed.

If a fatal I/O, solver, or export exception interrupts the run, the staging
files already produced by that run are retention-moved to the output-root
`_failed_runs/<run_id>/`; they are never left in the `dic/` root as if they were
current successful output. The run reports failure rather than committing a
partial result. This is distinct from a normally skipped no-finite-strain
frame. Old successful outputs remain traceable in output-root
`_previous_runs/<run_id>/`.

Each valid frame also gets `frame_####_parameters.txt`, a human-readable provenance record. It records the fixed `reference_frame_1based` and `reference_filename`, the analyzed `frame_global_1based` and `frame_filename`, `field_roi`, image shape, and effective `subset_size_px`, `step_px`, `strain_window`, `solver`, `zncc_min`, and smoothing settings (plus the sequence fingerprint when available).

The full-field UI exposes a visible optional **Exx overlay** switch. The overlay is written as `frame_NNNN_overlay.png` over the analyzed image and is additional visual QC, not a replacement for the core tables/maps. The 1D export controls do not participate in, and cannot gate, the fixed 2D core output. Preflight requires at least a **3 × 3 POI grid**; a field ROI that is too narrow for three rows or three columns is blocked before processing.

## Virtual-extensometer output

```text
core/      strain_*.txt · optional OPJU · strain plots
qc/        qc_summary.txt
optional/  full CSV, correlation plots, overlays, parameters, publication_figures/
```

Primary 1D TXT:

```text
Frame	EngineeringStrain	TrueStrain
```

```text
engineering strain = (L - L0) / L0
true strain        = ln(L / L0)
PoissonRatio       = - ε_transverse / ε_axial   (engineering)
```

Failed tracking frames stay `NaN`. Poisson uses role-averaged groups; tiny axial magnitude also gives `NaN`.

## Windows quick start

1. Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/D-sudoasd/ezDIC/releases) and download a published, frozen-smoke-verified Windows x64 asset for a version that is currently listed there. An unverified local ZIP is not a release asset.
2. Extract the full downloaded folder; the portable package's top-level directory is `ezDIC_Windows_x64`. Keep `_internal/` next to `ezDIC.exe` and retain the license, citation, version, and notice files.
3. Run `ezDIC.exe` on Windows 10/11 x64.

For source use:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe dic_virtual_extensometer_gui_v7_multi_roi_range.py
```

For tests and the release-build toolchain, install the pinned build/test set:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

### Headless CLI (v0.2.0-dev source and frozen contract)

The implemented source CLI is GUI-independent and reads strict UTF-8 JSON
configuration against `schemas/run_config_v1.json`. Relative paths resolve next
to the configuration file; non-finite numbers, unknown keys, invalid mode
fields, and unsupported input shapes are rejected. `image_paths` and
`image_folder` are mutually exclusive. A folder is collected with ezDIC's
natural image ordering and supported image suffixes. Keep analysis outputs and
benchmark reports outside the repository (for example under a caller-owned
temporary directory).

The following are minimal complete configurations. Replace the example image
and output paths with real paths; the field names are the schema field names.
The 1D reference must equal `start_frame_1based`; the 2D field-ROI reference
must equal `reference_frame_1based`. A 2D run processes the selected reference
first for initialization, then correlates every other selected frame to that
same fixed reference.

# Validate and execute the current source contract

Exit codes are stable: `0` means configuration, execution, scientific gate,
and manifest verification all passed; `2` means configuration/usage or
preflight failure; `3` means an I/O, solver, export, or other runtime failure;
and `4` means a scientific gate or manifest-verification failure.
`run --progress-json` emits line-delimited JSON `run_started`, `progress`, and
`run_finished` events while retaining the same exit-code contract. The source
entrypoint is `python ezdic_cli.py`; the frozen onedir bundle exposes the same
contract as `ezDIC-cli.exe` alongside the windowed `ezDIC.exe`.

Headless runs use the same fixed reference and numerical core as the GUI. Their
transaction lifecycle is the output root's current `core/`, `qc/`, `optional/`,
or `dic/` files, recoverable sibling `_previous_runs/<run_id>/` archives, and
retained fatal-run sibling `_failed_runs/<run_id>/` staging. Existing current
outputs are archived only during commit; a failed run does not replace them.
The registration row in a 1D result is a reference baseline and is excluded
from the scientific deformation-frame gate. A failed POI may retain its `x`/`y`
grid coordinates, while measurement fields (`u`/`v`, strain, and applicable
quality fields) remain `NaN`.

A run manifest binds canonical configuration, ordered input identities and
hashes, image shape/dtype, normalization bounds, code/environment fingerprints,
output inventory and hashes, status, and the scientific gate.
`verify-manifest` recomputes this contract and detects changed, missing,
unexpected, or tampered manifest-listed files without modifying user data.

The optional Origin OPJU export additionally requires Windows, OriginPro 2021+, a valid local OriginPro license, and `requirements-origin.txt`:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-origin.txt
```

Build a Windows portable package with `powershell -File .\build_release.ps1`. The build script validates release metadata, runs its checks fail-closed, and copies the support files into the package.

The development portable build is an onedir package containing `ezDIC.exe`,
`ezDIC-cli.exe`, the GUI-independent core/CLI/benchmark modules, and
`schemas/run_config_v1.json`. The wrapper's `--smoke-test` path imports the
core/CLI/benchmark contract before any Tk root and performs read-only checks.
It writes a marker only when `EZDIC_FROZEN_SMOKE_MARKER` points to a
caller-provided temporary path.

The default 1D tracking policy is a fixed reference template
(`template_policy=fixed_reference`, `use_prev_frame_template=false`).
`follow_deformed_experimental` is available only when explicitly enabled and
is not part of the fixed-reference claim. For full-field quality, the
`best_to_second_peak_ratio_min` value means `best_peak / second_peak`; larger
is better and the default lower bound is 1.02. It is not the inverse
`second_peak / best_peak` ratio. The positive coverage defaults are a minimum
0.95 correlation-valid fraction and 0.80 strain-valid fraction; they can be
made stricter in a caller configuration but are never silently relaxed.

The locked v5 synthetic engineering gate currently records the following clean
baseline values (`report_version=ezdic-benchmark-report-v5`,
`cases_version=ezdic-benchmark-cases-v3`, locked case hash
`3dbe0dae3fdf8f30ec32c9fd8f036f0a53b4a705380626e7860773f62f31cb20`):

| Case | Measured value | Gate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Small translation `[2.3, -1.2]` | RMSE **0.0199391 px**, P95 **0.0292620 px**, max **0.0325828 px** | strict clean baseline |
| Large translation `[28, -18]`, 3 pyramid levels, search radius 8 | RMSE **0.0115297 px**, P95 **0.0239809 px**, max **0.0269902 px** | strict clean baseline |
| Affine field | displacement RMSE **0.00363440 px**, P95 **0.00651265 px**, max **0.0103737 px** | strict clean baseline |
| Affine strain | max component error **0.000273879**, consistency error **0.000270908** | strict clean baseline |
| Near-1D periodic texture | typed `AMBIGUOUS_TEXTURE` before solver/export; `solver_calls=0`, 0 artifacts | typed rejection; artifacts = 0 |

The quality-score v1 ranking covers **567 numeric solver rows**: **563 good**
and **4 bad** labels, including **2 rejected bad** rows. It records
ROC-AUC **0.994227353463588** with error tolerance **0.25 px** (gate ≥ 0.90).
The illustrative threshold is explicitly `NOT_CALIBRATED`,
`quality_threshold_evaluated=false`, and `quality_threshold_pass=null`; it is
not a calibrated binary acceptance rule. Under finite-error labels the false
accept count is **2/2 = 100%**; under ranking outcomes it is **2/4 = 50%**.
The JSON report is hash-linked to its non-empty per-point CSV. These rates and
the ranking AUC must not be read as experimental accuracy, uncertainty, or
natural-texture performance.
In plain terms, this quality threshold is **not calibrated**.

The canonical evidence CSV SHA-256 is
`39d4e52f35cd3161a1e877b6edcd5187568bf275c6c8d552422605b73b4c0bfb`.

These are deterministic synthetic engineering-gate observations for the locked
geometry, seeds, clean baselines, and image-corruption panel. They are not
experimental uncertainty, calibration validation, or evidence that ezDIC is
more accurate or robust than every other DIC project.

## Scientific and implementation limits

Full-field DIC is an in-plane local-subset method using IC-GN / IC-LM with a first-order affine subset warp. It reports a POI grid, not per-pixel values; it is not stereo / 3D DIC, DVC, GPU/MPI, SIFT/AKAZE feature guidance, crack-topology masking, or global finite-element DIC. Arbitrary experimental texture is not an accepted capability claim. Pixel coordinates and displacements remain in px unless the user supplies an external calibration; strain values are dimensionless. Experimental calibration and uncertainty quantification are not implemented in this target. Failed subsets stay `NaN`, and finite output or a passing synthetic gate is not by itself experimental validation.

Relative to projects with stereo/3D, DVC, global-FE, GPU/MPI, or broader feature-guided solvers, ezDIC deliberately does not claim those capabilities. Its intended narrow advantage is an auditable local workflow for the fixed-reference 2D tensile-image scenario: one numerical core, deterministic normalization, explicit quality/strain validity, transactional output, and reproducible synthetic gates.
